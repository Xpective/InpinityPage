Overview

Inpinity is more than a platform – it’s a home for visionary game creators. We combine traditional game development tools with cutting‑edge blockchain technology to build a sustainable, community‑driven ecosystem.

Core principles:

· Community First: Every voice matters – from governance to guestbook entries.
· Transparency: Open‑source development, locked team tokens until “Judgment Day”.
· Innovation: Integration with Base L2, ToshiMart, and Uniswap for low‑cost, secure transactions.
